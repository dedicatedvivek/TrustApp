% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Stereo vision is an imaging technique that can provide full field of view 3D measurements in an unstructured and dynamic environment.The key problem to solve stereo vision are to identify which pixel in multiple images match the same world feature .This problem is known as stereo matching or stereo correspondence. Stereo Matching is for a given two or more images of the same scene or object, compute a representation of its shape. Stereo Matching is process of finding disparity or depth information.
\\There are many algorithms for stereo matching have been proposed, the computation of disparity still remains challenging in texture less regions, depth discontinuities and occluded areas.The stereo matching problems can formulate in terms of Markov Random Field as minimum energy function, to find energy minimization function is NP-hard. This means a general solution to this problem will take an unthinkably long time to reach a solution.\\
Belief propagation algorithm is an approach which find the approximate solution for minimum energy functions used for stereo matching.
Belief propagation algorithm considers both vertical and horizontal consistency is most robust method in the presence of texture less regions and occlusion.
