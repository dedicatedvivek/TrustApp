A parallax is ability to see an object at two different views. Parallax is a difference in the observable position of an object viewed along the two different lines of sight and is measured by an angle between those lines.\newline
As an illustration for parallax is that, as we know that earth revolves around the sun every year, earth takes its position opposite side of the sun every six months because of parallax effect nearby stars will seems to move relative distance than faraway stars. Another example for parallax effect is that hold a pencil at arm's length and look at it through one eye than other eye it looks like it shifts its position actually it not changes its position.\newline
 As another illustration how disparity can be appears is that by holding index finger one near to the face other as far as one can reach, on alternately viewing the scene with left eye and right eye. The distance between two fingers is different in left than in right eye which is due to relative position in two retinae are disparate.\newline
Disparity is defined as the difference in the location of the object between right eye's and left eye's image. The amount of disparity depends on the depth.
The depth is difference in distance to the two objects and distance to the point of fixation. Due to the parallax effect and human being's eye structure in such way that can see the objects in 3D depth. However the disparity also depends on distance to the fixation as well as disparity are interpreted as estimates of fixation of distance. The same principle is used while finding disparities for stereoscopic images\newline

\end{figure}
The stereoscopic images or stereo pair consists of two images of the same scene taken slightly horizontally separated points from the left view and the right view. The parallax effect also present in stereoscopic images in such a way that objects near the camera will represent more o the right in the left image and more left in the right image.
The horizontal displacement of an object left and right view depends on the distance from the object to the camera view points.\newline To find the matching pixel in left and right image for stereo pair image is known as \textbf{stereo vision, stereo correspondence or stereo matching.}
In stereo matching aim is to find the matching pixel for a stereo pair image as input image which consists of left and right image and result of finding matching pixel is saved as Depth map or disparity map.The disparity is horizontal distance between two matching pixel and horizontal pixel distance for each pixel coordinates is nothing but Disparity map.\newline The Depth map or Disparity map is a gray scale image which is highly compressed. The Depth map or Disparity map shows distance rather than texture.If shift of pixel between  right and left stereo image is more than object looks darker which is located far away from camera and if shift is less than object is bright i.e. object close to the camera.\newline
Stereo matching Algorithm is classified as \textbf{Area-based, Feature- based and Global algorithm}.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item The Area and feature based algorithms are based on intensity profile. The constrains in area- based algorithm is to find the optimal size of the window.
   \item The feature-based algorithms are restricted to using only specific feature, that only yield sparse disparity maps.
   \item The Global algorithms are based on Bayesian approach finds disparity   as an energy minimization problem. The Global stereo algorithms are Graph cut and belief propagation.
 \end{enumerate}
 
\textbf{Some applications of Depth Map or Disparity Map are}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To reconstruct 3D model sequences which can be used either for information transfer or for entertainment.
  \item For robot application for   navigation purpose and for object recognition to separate occluded image components.
  \item Scientific application of Depth Map or Disparity Map  are to extracts information from aerial surveys and for calculation of contour maps
\item For Gaze correction for video conference and for Image sequence analysis
\end{itemize}

%Now a days, wireless communications has become necessary to our lives and we transmit a lot of data every day. The main way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves, in particular radio waves. However, radio waves can support only limited bandwidth because of restricted spectrum availability and interference. Furthermore, radio spectrum is full to bursting and it is difficult to find radio capacity to support media applications \cite{r3}.
%
%There is an emerging wireless communication technology with a promising future and which can be a complement of radio waves: Visible Light Communication (VLC). VLC uses the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit information. This emerging technology offers optical wireless communications by using visible light. The visible spectrum is 10000 times larger than that of radio spectrum. The premise behind VLC is that because light is present everywhere now a days, communications can ride along for nearly free.
%
%VLC is basically a short range optical wireless communication technology that uses a visible light source as a signal transmitter, the air as a transmission medium or channel and a signal receiving device. Generally, the transmitters are Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) while the principal device of the receiver is a photodetector, usually a photodiode. By using VLC in short distance applications, we can supplement radio waves achieving high data rates and a larger bandwidth \cite{r1}.
%
%Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the visible light spectrum, which covers wavelengths between 380 nm-780 nm. We have already a lot of LED-based lights installed in the world and we can use them for communications. A LED is a semiconductor device that has the advantages of fast switching, power efficiency and emits visible light that is safe for the human because it is not harmful to vision. Therefore, we can both illuminate and transmit data everywhere \cite{r1}.
%
%Recently, LED research has focused on the emerging lighting infrastructure due to Green IT technical innovations. LED lighting is superior to existing incandescent and fluorescent lighting in terms of the long life expectancy, high tolerance to humidity, minimal heat generation, and low power consumption. Another important benefit of LEDs is that it is a controllable digital device. Therefore, many attempts have been made to merge LEDs with information technology (IT). Among them, visible light communication (VLC), which uses LED as a communicating device, has emerged as a new Green IT convergence technology.
%
%We can see the VLC environment in the Figure \ref{vlc}. All devices such as TV, fridge, PC etc. are wirelessly connected to the network. After the deployment of 3G systems, researchers have observed that human needs are moving towards more and more bandwidth hungry applications. In order to fulfil the needs, fourth generation (4G) and beyond systems are being introduced realizing the fact that heterogeneous access techniques must be available. Now the race is not to connect every human with internet but everything will be wirelessly connected to the network.

%\subsection {Brief history of Visible Light Communication.}
%The use of light to send messages is a very old idea. Fire and smoke signalling were used in ancient civilizations. For example, the ancient Greeks used polished shields to reflect sunlight to signal in the battle and Roman records indicate that polished metal plates were used as mirrors to reflect sunlight for long distance signalling. Chinese started using fire beacons followed by the Romans and American Indians using
%smoke signals.
%
%In the early 1800s, the US military used a wireless solar telegraph called “Heliograph” which is shown in figure that signals using
%Morse code flashes of sunlight reflected by a mirror. The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter. The diagram of heliograph is shown in Figure \ref{helio}. The navy often uses blinking lights, i.e. Aldis lamps, to
%send messages also using Morse code from one ship to another.

%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%
%%\pagebreak
%
%In 1880, the first example of VLC technology was demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell with his “photophone” that used sunlight
%reflected off a vibrating mirror and a selenium photo cell to send voice on a light beam. The transmitter and receiver of photophone is shown in Figure \ref{sun}.
%\begin{figure}[h]

%\caption{(a) Photophone transmitter. (b) Photophone receiver and handset \cite{r17}.} \label{sun}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%
%Until the late 1960s, radio and radar communications were more successful than optical communications
%(OC). OC started to get real attention with the invention of the light amplification by stimulated emission of
%radiation (laser) and the laser diode (LD) in the 1960s, followed in the 1970s by the development of lowloss
%optical fibres (OFs) as a medium for transmitting information using light, the invention of the OF amplifier in the 1980s, and the invention of the in-fibre Bragg grating in the 1990s. These inventions formed the basis for the telecommunications revolution of the late 20th century and provided the infrastructure for the Internet. The Nobel Prize in physics 2009 went to three scientists (Charles K. Kao, Willard S. Boyle,
%George E. Smith) who have played important roles in shaping the modern information technology due to
%their ground breaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical
%communication. Advancements in basic opto-electronic devices, such as LEDs (light emitting diodes) and
%LDs, p-intrinsic-n (PIN) photodiodes (PDs) and avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) and various optical
%components have attracted engineers to consider optical sources for wireless data transmission which has
%led to modern optical wireless communications (OWC) \cite{r17}.
%
%The first indoor OWC system was developed over 25 years ago. In 1979, an indoor OWC system was
%presented by Gfeller and Bapst. In their system, diffuse optical radiation in the near-IR region was
%utilised to interconnect a cluster of terminals located in a room to a common cluster controller.
%During the last ten years, we have witnessed the emergence of visible light communications (VLC) fuelled
%by solid-state lighting (SSL) technology. SSL is a rapidly developing area, both in terms of commercial
%exploitation, and academic and industrial research. LEDs with a wide range of colours are available,
%including white light. The output power as well as device efficiencies are increasing rapidly. The field of
%applications is also expanding. White LEDs are commonly used as replacements for incandescent lamps due
%to more than 10 times improved energy efficiency. Therefore, LED lighting is set to revolutionise the way
%we illuminate our homes, offices, public buildings and streets.
%
%These SSL sources, being semiconductor devices, come with an additional feature. Their light intensity can
%be varied at very high speeds, and so their functionality can be extended by means of intensity modulation
%(IM) to also become a wireless communication device.
%
%VLC originated in Japan and the visible light communications consortium (VLCC) was established in
%November 2003. The VLCC has major companies in Japan on board and aims at publicising and
%standardising VLC technology. The formation of the VLCC has stimulated worldwide interest in VLC
%technology, and the first IEEE standard for VLC - IEEE 802.15.7 – has emerged recently. University of
%Edinburgh academics have worked on VLC since 2004 and have developed enhanced modulation schemes
%that enable high data rates to be achieved using standard LED light bulbs.

%%The idea of using light as a communication medium was implemented by Alexander
%%Graham Bell in 1880 with his invention of the photophone, a device that transmitted a
%%voice signal on a beam of light. Bell focused sunlight with a mirror and then talked into a
%%mechanism that vibrated the mirror. The vibrating beam was picked up by the detector at
%%the receiving end and decoded back into the voice signal, the same procedure as the
%%phone did with electrical signals. But Bell could not generate a useful carrier frequency,
%%nor was he able to transmit the light beam from point to point. Obstacles in nature such as
%%fog and rain — which could interfere with the photophone — made Bell stop any future research into his invention [7]. With the invention of LED (Light Emitting Diode), the
%%idea of using light as a communication medium has started again. VLC uses white Light
%%Emitting Diodes (LED), which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the
%%human eye. One major advantage of VLC is that we can use the infrastructure around us
%%without having to make any changes to it. LEDs’ ability to transfer information signals
%%over light ( light which is between 400THz to 800THz of frequency and whose
%%wavelength is between 400nm to 700nm ) makes it a very good communication medium.
%%Now the light we use in our daily life can not only be used for providing light but also for
%%communication.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%Human being has used a visible light source as a form of data transmission since ancient
%%times.Since ancient times humans are using it in simple form. For example, in old times to give war signals, they used reflection of sunlight using brushed iron piece or smoke in day time and at night they were using fire to give signals. That was the best and very effective way to inform others by giving signal like this for that time as technology was not developed enough.

%\subsection {Spectrum Analysis}
%Since Visible light communication is a data communication technology that uses visible light between 380 nm and 780 nm. These wavelengths correspond to a frequency range of approximately 384 THz to 789 THz. In Figure \ref{mux} and \ref{vlc}, we can see a diagram of the visible light spectrum. The visible light spectrum is 10000 times larger than that of radio spectrum.

%\subsection {Characteristics of VLC}
%
%The main characteristics of this technology are summarized below \cite{r1}:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Bandwidth :
%The bandwidth is virtually not limited, it offers a frequency band of  approximately 400THz.
%  \item Efficiency :
%VLC is highly energy efficient since illumination and transmission of data are done at the same time.
%  \item Data Rates :
%VLC can achieve high data rates (hundreds of Mb/s) and it can therefore be used for high speed wireless communications.
%  \item Cost :
%As VLC uses the visible light spectrum it is free of cost. Furthermore, transmitters and receivers are cheap.
%  \item Human Safety :
%VLC is harmless to human health and it is not injurious to the human eye.
%  \item Omnipresent Nature :
%We have the infrastructure because there are already a lot of LED-based lights installed in the world which are potential VLC transmitters and therefore we can use them for communications.
%  \item Security :
%As light waves do not penetrate opaque objects they can not  be intercepted, so it offers a very secure communication. It is very difficult for an intruder to make use of your signal.
%  \item Visibility :
%It is great to see data being communicated by a beam of light. What you see is what you send!

%The infrared communication is standardized by the IrDA (Infrared Data Association) and
%the IrDA is still developing advanced application of infrared communication. The data rate
%for infrared communication (Knutson, 2004) includes 4 Mb/s (FIR), 16 Mb/s (VFIR), and etc.
%On the other hand, the VLC data rate is dependent on the LED’s modulation bandwidth and
%the standardization on physical layer specifications has not yet been published. Some of researches have reached around 20 Mb/s. Since the resonant-cavity LEDs shows the modulation bandwidth $>$ 100 Mb/s, it is expected that the VLC system with $>$ 100 Mb/s
%data rate is possible by using the high-speed LEDs and appropriate multiplexing techniques.
%
%The transmission distance for VLC is possible up to several meters due to its illumination
%requirement. Since the infrared communication is used for a remote controller, the
%maximum distance is ~ 3 meters. The VLC transmitter emits multiple-wavelength light from
%red to violet and the exact analysis will become more complex than infrared communication.
%
%Due to the wavelength of the light source, the noise sources will be different. For infrared
%communication, noise comes from ambient light containing infrared light. In the case of
%VLC, the sunlight and other illumination light can be noise sources. Also, the visible light is
%in our daily lives and we can detect it with human eye. Therefore, the VLC is eye safe.
%% The infrared communication has the long history and many applications have been developed
%%and are listed in (IrDA website). On the other hand, the VLC has shorter history and the
%%small number of applications has been proposed. Nevertheless, the illumination exists
%%everywhere and the VLC using the illumination infrastructure can be used easily.
%%By utilizing the characteristics of VLC link, it is expected to be candidate infrastructure for
%%indoor/outdoor public ubiquitous communication technology in the near future.

%\subsection{Comparison with Radio Waves}
%Although radiofrequency communications is the most popular
%technology today, it also has disadvantages. VLC is compared
%with radiofrequency using five main concepts.
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Capacity :
%  Radio spectrum is full and it is difficult to find radio
%capacity to support the demand of wireless data transmissions
%for media applications. The radio waves are limited, expensive
%and there is only a certain range of it. By using VLC more
%spectrums will be available and due to the infrastructure of
%LED-based lights installed in the world there is a potential for
%VLC as transmitters.
%  \item Efficiency :
%  Radio waves consume a lot of energy while VLC is
%highly energy efficient since illumination and transmission of
%data are done at the same time.
%  \item Cost :
%  VLC transmitters and receivers devices are cheap, there
%is no need for using expensive RF units.
%  \item Safety :
%  Radio wave creates Electromagnetic Interference
%(EMI), known to interfere with airplanes’ instruments and
%equipment in hospitals, and is potentially dangerous in
%hazardous operations, such as power/nuclear generation or oil
%and gas drilling. On the other hand, VLC uses light instead of
%radio waves, which is intrinsically safe and does not create
%EMI. Hence, this technology can be used in many places.
%  \item Security :
%  Radio waves penetrate through walls and they can be
%intercepted. By using VLC data is transmitted where the light is
%because light does not penetrate through walls, that is to say,
%VLC provide a secure data communication.
%\item Human Health :
%The transmission power of radio waves van
%cannot be increased over a certain level because there are
%serious health risks for humans. VLC is an attractive candidate
%in a consumer communication system.
