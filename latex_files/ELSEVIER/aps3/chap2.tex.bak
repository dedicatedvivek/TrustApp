\chapter{Introduction to Stereo matching}

A person lives in a three-dimensional,spatial, environment ,without a feeling for space, cannot move within it.Our perception of space is created almost exclusively by our eyes. There are many ways to orient oneself in space, e.g., by perspective, gradation of color, contrast and movement.\newline
The 3D experience comes from the left and right eye seeing slight different views .This effect is known as binocular vision.The binocular vision shown in diagram 2.1

Binocular vision determines the position of a point in space by finding the intersection of the two lines passing through the center of projection and the projection of the point in each image.In binocular vision where separate images from two eyes are successively combined into one 3D image in the brain.\newline
The above figure explains about appearance of objects in depth as perceived by normal binocular vision.\newline The perception of depth occur from disparity of a given 3D point in right and left retinal images.

The method of finding depth from disparity is known as triangulation,which is shown in diagram 2.2. The 3D location of any visible object point in space is restricted to the straight line that passes through the center of projection and the projection of the object point.
The formation of 3D image shown in diagram 2.3.

The disparity  is difference in image location of the same 3D point for 3D image,when projected under  two or more different cameras.\newline
The stereo image is captured by two cameras at two different view point of same scene or object.
Two problems arises when finding disparity for stereo image.They are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use of  prior knowledge or camera calibration
  \item Finding corresponding point in right image for each point in left image which known as stereo vision problem , stereo matching or stereo correspondence.
\end{enumerate}
The camera calibration may not required  while using projectile approach for two images.The projectile approach is known as epipolar geometry which uses properties of rays rather than intrinsic parameters of camera.\newline The epipolar lines are the projection of the pencil of planes passing through the centers of the two or more images. The  concept of epipolar lines shown in figure 2.4. Even for two images (or images with collinear camera centers) can find epipolar lines.

%The multiplier architecture can be generally classified into three categories. First is the serial multiplier which emphasizes on hardware and minimum amount of chip area. Second is parallel multiplier (array and tree) which carries out high speed mathematical operations. But the drawback is the relatively larger chip area consumption. Third is serial- parallel multiplier which serves as a good trade-off between the times consuming serial multiplier and the area consuming parallel multipliers.
The image rectification is to make the epipolar  lines of two camera images horizontally aligned. This may be accomplished by using linear transformations that rotate, translate and skew the camera images.\newline
The principle of image rectification is shown in  figure 2.5. The original camera image planes are drawn with solid borders and the rectified image planes are drawn with dashed borders. Epipolar lines are also drawn from the projected points p and p'to epipoles e and e'\newline

\end{center}
\end{figure}
After image rectification has been carried out, the epipolar lines of two projected points are parallel and horizontally aligned along the new image planes.\newline The stereo matching problem is therefore reduced to a one dimensional search along horizontal lines instead of a two dimensional search.\newline Camera images before rectification,pixel matching is a 2D search problem whereas Camera images after rectification,pixel matching can be done through a one dimensional line search.

Camera images before rectification, pixel matching is a 2D search problem while Camera images after rectification ,pixel matching can be done through a one dimensional line search,which is shown in figure 2.6.
\section{Disparity and Disparity map}
In stereo matching, the target is to find matching pixels of two given input images and the result from finding matching pixels is normally saved as a disparity map. The term disparity can be looked upon as horizontal distance between two matching pixels and the disparity map defines a value of this horizontal pixel distance for each image pixel coordinate. Hence, it may be seen as a function of d(x, y) image pixel coordinates \newline
In practice, depth maps are stored as gray scale images that show distance instead of texture. This means that an object located close to the camera turns out bright while a faraway located object looks darker (or vice versa).\newline The relation between intensity and distance has to be specified somehow (e.g. by defining the nearest and farthest distance values of the intensity range 0-255)
