\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}
\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understand the concept related to Markov Random Field and probability theory related to stereo matching algorithm
  \item Done Literature survey on stereo matching algorithm using iterative Belief Propagation algorithm
 \item Initial Depth map as a preprocessing stage is implemented using MATLAB in build command 'DisparityMap'from computer vision tool box.The second method Minimum Index Method for Initial Depth Map also implemented.
 \item The optimization algorithm Belief Propagation for both methods are implemented.The results for both stereo images shows that BP algorithm identifies the objects
\end{itemize}
\section{Futre Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Ghost image is present in Initial Depth Map itself,The same ghost image is carry forward after applying Belief propagation algorithm also,In future  going to work on this issue
  \item The BP algorithm  can be tested with some natural  stereo images or from some other source.
\end{itemize}
