\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}
\section{conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understand the concept related to Markov Random Field and probability theory related to stereo matching algorithm
  \item Done Literature survey on stereo matching algorithm using iterative Belief Propagation algorithm
 \item Initial Depth map as a preprocessing stage is implemented using MATLAB in build command 'DisparityMap'
\end{itemize}
