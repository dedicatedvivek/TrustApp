\chapter{Conclusion}
The terms and concepts related to Markov Random Field (MRF)formulation and Message updates in iterative inference belief propagation are studied.\newline
Literature survey on  major contribution in the field of stereo matching using  Markov Random field and inference algorithm like Belief Propagation are studied to find gap analysis for further research. \newline
Implemented  Markov Random Field (MRF)formulation\newline
\textbf{Future Work} is
to improve the disparity map which is produced by Markov Random Field by  using  iterative inference  Belief Propagation algorithm
