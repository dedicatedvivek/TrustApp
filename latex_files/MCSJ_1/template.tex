$\gamma$ & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{parameter_values}
\end{table}

Sections and subsections should be numbered and titled as 1.0, 2.0, etc. and 1.1, 1.2, 2.1,2.2.1, etc. respectively. Capital letters should be used for the section titles. For subsections, the first letter of each word should be in capital letter, followed by small letters.

\subsection{References}
References should be noted with numbers \cite{01}, \cite{02}, \cite{03}, etc. at the right of the corresponding part of the text. The numbers should be the same as the references listed at the end of the manuscript under the heading REFERENCES (left-justified). Reference to articles in periodicals should take the form: initial(s) and name(s) of author(s), title (within quotes “ ”), title of journal (in italic), volume number, issue number, year published and page numbers.

Reference to conference proceedings/reports should take the form: initial(s) and name(s) of author(s), title (within quotes “ ”), name of conference in full (in italic), venue and date held, volume number (if any)/report number and page numbers. Reference to books should take the form: initial(s) and name(s) of author(s), title of book (in italic), edition (if any), place of publication, publisher and year published. Indicate chapters/page numbers where relevant.

The biography section should give the profiles of each author including name, academic achievements, affiliations to professional bodies, working experience, etc. within 100 words at the end of the manuscript. It should be placed below the references under the heading BIOGRAPHY (left-justified) and leaving a double spacing in between.

The Editor reserves the right to edit/format the manuscript to maintain a consistent style.
