Indicate chapters/page numbers where relevant. 

The biography section should give the profiles of each author including name, academic achievements, affiliations to professional bodies, working experience, etc. within 100 words at the end of the manuscript. It should be placed below the references under the heading BIOGRAPHY (left-justified) and leaving a double spacing in between.
