In signal processing, the function of a filter is to remove unwanted
parts of the signal, such as random noise, or to extract useful
parts of the signal, such as the components lying within a certain
frequency range \cite{kilbas_srivastava_trujillo}.



\section{Introdution}

Digital filters are typically used to modify or alter the attributes
of a signal in the time or frequency domain. The most c



\section{Organization of the report}
Chapter 2 discusses the various ways of implementing the digital filter and tells that why fpga implementation is better compare to others.

chapter 3 discusses design stage for digital filter, which includes specification of
filter, calculation of filter coefficients, realization of filter structure, finite world length
effect and the design using windowing techniques are given in this chapter.


In Chapter 4, the Simulation and Synthesis tools which are used in implementation of
FIR filter is discussed. This chapter also discusses the FPGAs architecture, FPGA Design
Flow.


Chapter 5 discusses about how FIR filter can be realized and the process of
implementation of FIR filter. It also discusses restriction and assumption of filter,
choosing the filter structure, because it is often important to choose a particular filter
structure for a given transfer function H(z).This chapter also discusses Fixed Point
Representation of data.



Chapter 6 contains results of simulation using  XILINX ISE 10.1i of
lowpass FIR filter.

Chapter 7 concludes the project and also discusses future scope of work.
