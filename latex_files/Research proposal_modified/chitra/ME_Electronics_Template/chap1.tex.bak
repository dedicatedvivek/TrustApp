\chapter{Literature Survey}
[1] One of the prime concern of our project is to handle SMS in an
Application Server. For this purpose we use GSM modem which will be
connected through DKU-5 data cable. For handling SMS we needed to
learn how to do processing of SMS. For SMS processing we referred
following website link : http://www.developershome.com/sms/ [2] As
JSP is used in our project for interaction web browser application
with database stored in Railway Database server. We referred
following website for description of JSP.
http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/ [3] As we are using MS Access 2000
for storing all the databases. As a database is a vital component,
database has to be managed efficiently. Also we have to consider the
security of the database as primary concern . For Database
management and Database Security, we referred Microsoft's online
Help for MS Access $<$

\textbf{Previous work}\\
Mobile ticketing technology, implemented by the APT SKIDATA and
SMARTMACHINES systems [4]  in the United Kingdom. The technology
enables consumers to buy tickets for major events such as rock
concerts; football matches etc. through their mobile phones. The
ticketing technology was successfully tried for the first time at
the Aston Villa v West Bromwich Albion match on April 10th, 2005.
With the help of this technology, consumers can send an SMS to order
their tickets via mobile phone. They then receive a return SMS which
has an image with a 2-dimenstional matric-code. This SMS contains
details such as the ticket number, the mobile phone number and the
seat number. On entering the stadium, the consumers have to hold
their mobile phone with this image SMS open, in front of the
scanners installed by Smartmachine systems at the venue of the
event. These scanners validate the users and allow them to enter
inside the venue. The consumers are charged for their tickets by the
mobile service provider once the 2-D code is scanned at the scanning
machines.
