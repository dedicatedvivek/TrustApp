%%  Usage:
%%
%%  With LaTeX 2.09 one should use this style file as
%%
%%  \documentstyle[12pt,csaslide]{article}
%%  \begin{document}
%%  \author{Name of the author}
%%  \topic{A short phrase describing the topic}
%%  \slidepage{Contents of page 1}
%%  \slidepage{Contents of page 2}
%%    ...
%%  \slidepage{Contents of last page}
%%  \end{documnet}
%%
%%  The same can be done using LaTeX2e as
%%
%%  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
%%  \usepackage{csaslide}
%%  \begin{document}
%%  ...
%%  \end{document}
%%
%%  Almost anything can be put in a slide including several paragraphs,
%%  mathematical formulas, tables and figures.
%%
%%  The status line at the bottom of the slide looks like:
%%
%%  Name of the author       A short phrase describing the topic       Page No
%%
%%  Text appearing in this status line can be controlled by invoking the
%%  commands \author, \topic and \version. For example, if you want a status
%%  line that looks like
%%
%%  About IIScians                  -- 13 --                   Version: 1.0.31
%%
%%  with the page numbering at the center, you should specify the following:
%%
%%  \author{About IIScians}
%%  \topic{-- \arabic{page} --}
%%  \version{Version: 1.0.31}
%%
%%  If you don't want the status line at all, call these commands as
%%
%%  \author{}
%%  \topic{}
%%  \version{}
%%
%%  The default page numbering comes at the lower right corner of the page as
%%  `Page 1', `Page 2' etc. If you want to put the total page number at that
%%  place, you must do two things:
%%
%%  \total{total number of pages}
%%  \showtotalpagenotrue
%%
%%  With these two commands, the page numbering looks like: `Page 1 of 18',
%%  `Page 2 of 18', ..., `Page 19 of 18', ..., (if you have set \total{18}).
%%
%%  If you want the csa logo at the top right corner of the page to be a
%%  color logo, you must set
%%
%%  \colorlogotrue
%%
%%  You may optionally specify the department name by the command
%%
%%  \dept{Your department name}
%%
%%  By default, it is set to the string `Dept. of Computer Science & Automation,
%%  IISc'. This text is printed in an fbox at the bottom of the frame
%%  surrounding the slide material. This text should not be too long (say, more
%%  than 75 characters wide), so that it can fit nicely in the space provided.
%%
%%  If you want wide slides (for example, for printing the slides in the
%%  landscape mode), you should specify
%%
%%  \landscapetrue
%%
%%  By default, \slidepage calls the routine \longslide. With this directive,
%%  however, another routine called \wideslide is called. Instead, of calling
%%  \slidepage, you may call these routines explicitly as well. The syntax
%%  for calling each of these three routines is the same, namely
%%
%%  \slidepage{Argument}
%%  \longslide{Argument}
%%  \wideslide{Argument}
%%
%%  All these routines assume that the target paper size is that of a
%%  standard A4 size paper. If you want to take printouts in papers of other
%%  sizes, you might face problems with exact alignment of the slides.
