\chapter{Conclusion} 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The literature survey on major contributions in optimization of stereo matching technique  using Belief Propagations are studied.
  \item The operational concepts and terms related to Markov Random Field and Belief propagation are studied.
  \item The implementation of stereo matching using BP are studied and understands  the issues in implementation.
\end{enumerate}
