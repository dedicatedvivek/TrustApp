% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
The stereo matching between two images is done by computing disparity of all the points on the object. The process involves identifying the corresponding points and finding the shift. There is no method that finds shift in the corresponding point or points showing corresponding objects. This is mainly due to no procedure that identifies the group of pixel from the same object. The local method either uses window or feature to find shift in stereo image. The issues in local method are size of  window or extraction of feature.\\
The global method uses graph theory and probability theory to find shift efficiently. The Global method  are based on Bayesian approach finds disparity   as an energy minimization problem. The Global stereo algorithms are Graph cut and belief propagation. The belief propagation algorithm is used as global algorithm  expected to offer computationally efficient approach with good results. The method used in this report is "Minimum sum Belief propagation" method as message updates with linear "Quadratic function ". The results with the computational estimations are presented.
