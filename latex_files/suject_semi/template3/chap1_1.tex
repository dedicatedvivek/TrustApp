\chapter{\textbf{Introduction}}
This report introduces Belief Propagation Techniques and presents some of the  applications.
\\ Belief Propagation Techniques approach uses the degree of a person's belief that an event will occur,rather than the actual probability  of the event will occur.
Belief probabilities are  properties of person's belief not the event.
\\ A Probabilistic model is a dependency model in which relationship between  each of the variable is captured.Dependency models  are represent by graphical methods.
\\ Belief Propagation Technique is used to perform inference on graphical  model  such as factor graphs which calculates marginal distribution for each unobserved node
conditional on observed node.
The graphical representation used for belief propagation Techniques are two types ,they are Markov  Random Fields and  Bayesian Networks.\cite{Hans Andrea Loeliger}
\\Belief Propagation Techniques  are used for performing inference on graphical models such as Bayesian Network and Markov Random Field\cite{Judea Pearl}
\\Bayesian network uses the directed graphs where the directions of the arrows permits distinguish genuine dependencies for spurious dependencies induced by hypothetical observations
\\In Markov Random  Fields,the network topology was presumed to be given and problem was to characterize the probabilistic  behavior  of a system complying with dependencies prescribed by network.
\\Belief Propagation Techniques are used in  Artificial Intelligence,Signal Processing and  Digital Communication.
\\Some of the applications where Markov  Random Fields and  Bayesian Networks  methods are used  either as  optimization tool or for implementation  are discussed in chapter 3
