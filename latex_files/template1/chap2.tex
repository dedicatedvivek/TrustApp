\textbf{Some of the major contributions in the optimization of BP streo matching are as follows:}\\
Chia-Kai et.al\cite{Chia} used Loopy Belief Propagation(LBP)with simple message update process to iteratively refine the beliefs of labels and showed that it could be effectively applied to the  problems like stereo matching, Image de-noising etc..

Pedro F.Felzenszwalb and Daniel P.Huttenlocher \cite{Felzen} used to find cost function by using distance transform technique ,grid graph and perform BP in a coarse to fine method  for solving early vision problem \\
Li Zhou et.al\cite{Li Zhoue} surveyed about  optimization potential for both stereo matching algorithm optimization and software or hardware implementation in terms of speed, parallelism, data bandwidth, memory storage, etc.
The Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) designs are future research trends in real time embedded stereo vision application systems because of their high parallel processing capabilities and specific powerful calculation supporting components.\\
Young-kyu Choi et.al\cite{Young} used reducing number of pixels (i.e. reduction in spatial domain) approach is used to reduce data size and transfer bandwidth is significantly reduced by storing only a part of the whole message to optimize the BP.
In order to maintain the accuracy, the local messages are reconstructed by taking advantage of the shared memory available in Graphic Processing Units (GPU)\\
Chi-Hua Lai et.al\cite{Chi-Hua Lai} used  parallelization of a belief propagation algorithm on the multicore processors have proposed. The methods used to demonstrate the issues in optimizing the algorithm by exploiting the potential parallelism to expose the architecture benefits. The methodology of analyzing and exploiting parallelism presented in this article is applicable to other stereo vision algorithms.\\
Eduardo.M et.al\cite{Ed} developed belief algorithm using functional VHDL hardware description language and is technology-independent. So, the system can be implemented on any large enough FPGA \\
Yu-Cheng Tseng et.al\cite{Y.C.} used to partitions an image to block and optimizes with belief propagation which reduces the memory size. The block based approach discontinuous disparities region occurs in the boundary of edges which can enhance the interaction between neighboring blocks such that the independent block could extract useful information from the neighboring finished processing block.\\
Radu Timofte et.al\cite{Radu} used Four-Color Theorem  technique for Belief propagation based on the max-product for solving early vision problems such as MRF problems where energy is to be minimized\\
Nama et.al \cite{Nam Ma} used method task scheduling which is more suitable tool for Parallel implementation of Belief Propagation in Factor Graphs a task dependency graph for belief propagation and then using a dynamic task scheduler to exploit task parallelism available in the task dependency graph.\\

\textbf{Problem Definition}:
It is proposed to work on the algorithm optimization and fast implementation of Belief Propagation algorithm without much degradation in accuracy\\


\textbf{Research Design:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Study the implementation of stereo matching using Belief Propagation and understands the issues in implementation. Study different techniques to optimize belief in different approaches

\item Try to evolve a new approach considering hardware and software implementation in Belief Propagation
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Expected Results:}

Development of a new/modify Belief Propagation optimization method for stereo matching application/cases of stereo matching. Comparative study of the new method with existing methods.
