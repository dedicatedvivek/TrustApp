\chapter{Conclusion}
Research process consists of series of actions or steps necessary to effectively carry out research. The research process consists of a number of closely related activities ,But such activities overlap continuously rather than following a strictly  prescribed sequence. If subsequent procedures have not been taken into account in the early stages, serious difficulties may arise which may even prevent the completion of the study. 

The various steps involved in a research process are not mutually exclusive  nor they are separate and distinct. They do not necessarily follow each other in any specific order and the researcher has to be constantly anticipating at each step in the research process the requirements of the subsequent steps.researcher has to be constantly anticipating at each step in the research process the requirements of the subsequent steps.
