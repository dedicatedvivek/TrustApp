\chapter{Conclusion}


The graphical representation or models for multidimentional probability distributions such as Markov  Random Fields and  Bayesian Networks are used for Belief Propagation Techniques.
Some of the applications results are obtained based on following Techniques:
Optimizing Markov  Random Fields to speed up the  Belief Propagation used for face recognition and low level vision problem

Another optimizing scheme which carries priority based message scheduling and dynamic label pruning extensions are used to handle  Markov  Random Field with large discrete space.

The block based Belief Propagation algorithm reduces memory size significantly due to block based computation.

A parallel techniques are used for implementation of Belief Propagation Techniques in acyclic  factor graphs.

A tile based Belief Propagation and fast construction techniques are realized both in Software and Hardware.

Learning continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are used for data streaming by using conditional log-likelihood scoring function.
